# password-generator
When presented with the password generator page you are presented with a "generate password" button. When the button is clicked you are prompted with a box that asks you how many characters you would like the password to be. After typing in how many characters you would like then you will be asked if you would like uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After correctly typing in responses a password will be generated with the correct info. To be able to do this was mostly done with if, else if, and return statements. If you incorrectly typed in a response an alert window will pop telling you what needs to be typed in in order to continue. With the "return" function you will be brought back to the start of the current function. Throught the use of console logs, the data from each response was stored in the console to correctly generate a password.If no options are selected you will generate a password of only lowercase letters. In the generatePassword function lowercase letters are selected no matter what, then if numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters are selected the randomly generated password will adjust. The password is unique each time by using the Math.floor and Math.random functions. Math.floor allows numbers to be rounded down to the nearest whole interger so there will be no decimals. Math.random presents randomly generated numbers and letters.
